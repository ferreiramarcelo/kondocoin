        You buy a voucher from a vending machine (yes, its an old condom machine).
        The voucher contains a code which you can enter on this website, along with your wallet id.
        We then compute the current value of your voucher in bitcoins and transfer the fund to your wallet.

        question: "I don't have a bitcoin wallet. Can you recommend one?"
        answer: |
          There are many bitcoin wallets available, ranging from paper wallets to android applications. All have specific advantages and disadvantages. For beginners, I recommend the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet since you do not have to download the blockchain and it works on a variety of devices.
      o0confusion: 
        question: "I entered my voucher code, but the system does not accept it."
        answer: "Please note that there is no \"O\" (the letter) in the code. The code
    consists of the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f. If you entered an \"O\"
    as in Octopus, try a zero as in 007 instead."
      blockchainlink:
        question: "When I redeemed my voucher, there was a link showing the
                    transaction in the blockchain. How can I find it again?"
        answer: "The blockchain is bitcoin's way of tracking who owns what. Since the blockchain is public, you can use sites such as blockchain.info to observe what is happening. When you enter your wallet id on such a site, you can see your transaction being processed."
      profit:
        question: "How much do you make?"
        answer: "Nothing. After paying for the server, the packaging and the condom
    machine itself I loose money."
      donations:
        question: "That is sad. Do you accept donations?"
        answer: "Yes, I do. Please send donations to 1MSa5eECnZsuzm4jTVCGbUkGNUXnqpVDjy."
      ownmachine:
        question: "This is a neat idea. Can I build one myself?"
        answer: "Absolutely! You just need a vending machine of some kind. The server
    software is available on github: https://github.com/gonium/kondocoin (GPLv3). Have fun!"
